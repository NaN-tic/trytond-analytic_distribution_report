Analytic Distribution Report Module
###################################

The Analytic Distribution Reports adds a menu entry to create new analytic
reports which allow the user to distribute the amount of a given analytic
account to other analytic accounts.

The result can be shown in table in a XLSX file which has analytic accounts in
the columns and accounts in the rows.
